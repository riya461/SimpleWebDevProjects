          <h1>Edinburgh Castle</h1>
          <p>
            Edinburgh Castle is a historic fortress which dominates the skyline of Edinburgh, the capital city of
            Scotland, from its position on the Castle Rock. Archaeologists have established human occupation of the rock
            since at least the Iron Age (2nd century AD), although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There
            has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site
            continued at times to be a royal residence until 1633.

          <h1>Eilean Donan Castle</h1>
          <p>
            Eilean Donan (Scottish Gaelic: Eilean Donnain) is a small tidal island where three sea lochs meet, Loch
            Duich, Loch Long and Loch Alsh, in the western Highlands of Scotland. A picturesque castle that frequently
            appears in photographs, film and television dominates the island, which lies about 1 kilometre (5⁄8 mi) from
            the village of Dornie. Since the castle's restoration in the early 20th century, a footbridge has connected
            the island to the mainland.

          <h1>Forth Bridge</h1>
          <p>
            The Forth Bridge is a cantilever railway bridge across the Firth of Forth in the east of Scotland, 9 miles
            (14 kilometres) west of central Edinburgh. It is considered as a symbol of Scotland (having been voted
            Scotland's greatest man-made wonder in 2016), and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[3] It was designed by the
            English engineers Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker.
